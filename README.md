# Financial Health & Risk Dashboard

This project analyzes financial KPIs (like ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity) across multiple industries and builds a machine learning model to classify companies as high-risk or healthy based on simulated financial data.

---

## Objective

- Analyze profitability, liquidity, leverage, and growth metrics across industries
- Train a binary classifier to detect financially at-risk companies
- Visualize KPIs, industry patterns, and model-driven insights

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn: Random Forest Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook
- Simulated financial dataset

---

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis on core KPIs  
- Correlation heatmap of financial metrics  
- Random Forest classifier to flag risky companies  
- Feature importance ranking for explainability  

---
